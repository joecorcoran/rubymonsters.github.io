# Where we meet

How to get to the office space [where we meet](http://goo.gl/maps/vmidH) (the former Travis CI office).

The address is Prinzessinnenstrasse 20, on the left driveway:

* You can either take the stairs on "Aufgang B" (staircase B). Go all the way
  up to the 5th floor. If the door is closed, knock, loudly. If no one opens,
  then hammer, really loudly :)

* Or you can find the elevator and use the doorbell. We'll then pick you up
  with the elevator.

* There also is another elevator inside of the building (just go through the
  Betahaus cafe, it's on the right side), go to 5th floor and find the door
  right next to the staircase.

Yes, this building can be somewhat confusing with all the staircases. When in
doubt just give us a call or send us a message and we'll pick you up :)

Even though it's in the same building as the well-known Betahaus we're not
related to them. We've just rented part of the top floor from the same
landlord.

This office is shared by a bunch of parties, such as 5Apps, Avarteq and Cileos,
which is why there's a generic name: Ganz Oben office :)
