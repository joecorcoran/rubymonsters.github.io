# Ruby Monstas' 4th birthday picnic

## Please come and join us!

<a href="http://rubymonstas.org/">Ruby Monstas</a> are celebrating their 4th
birthday with a BBQ and picnic at [Tempelhofer Feld](https://goo.gl/maps/d6Gm2FszWPw).

Over the last 4 years over a hundred people have participated in our study
groups at <a href="http://rubymonstas.org/">Ruby Monstas</a>. Many of us have
learned programming, and found new jobs in tech. Many are still best friends.

We would love this event to be a **reunion for everyone** who ever came by at Ruby
Monstas, our friends, the Berlin Rails Girls and Ruby community, and everyone
who ever was in touch with us in any way. So please join us!

<div id="event-meta">
  <ul>
    <li>When: Saturday, July 30th, 15:00</li>
    <li>Where: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/d6Gm2FszWPw">Tempelhofer Feld, Grillwiese</a></li>
    <li>By: <a href="http://rubymonstas.org/">Ruby Monstas</a></li>

  </ul>

What to bring? Whatever you like. We recommend: lots of happiness, a blanket,
beverages for yourself and some food you would like to share.

We'll bring some basic beverages and food, of course, but we won't know how
many of you will show up, so it's going to be limited.

If you have any questions ping us at [@rubymonstas](https://twitter.com/rubymonstas),
or drop us an [email](mailto:ruby.monsters@gmail.com).

P.S. Thank you for sharing with whoever might be interested <3
