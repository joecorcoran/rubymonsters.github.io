The Internet is practically ubiquitous. It carries our data everywhere using a
set of concise rules.

Most diagrams completely abstract all of the Internet away into a literal
drawing of a cloud. There's so much stuff going on inside, though, that even
many super-smart software developers don't know about. I really want to help us
all get our heads out of the clouds so we can have a better understanding of
computer networks work.

After the talk, my hope is that you can answer questions like:
What's an IP address?
Wait--what, seriously?
Okay, so how come that doesn't look like `google.com` _at all_?
What does my home router **actually do**?
What's a MAC address?
Literally, how does any of this even?

But mostly, I really want to show you why I think networks are totally rad. :)

an all-around nerdy queer person who wears a lot of black clothes, listens to
music way too loud, climbs up walls, and works remotely as an engineer for
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com) from the beautiful tropical paradise of
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the USA. You can usually find Emma with the
username "emdantrim".
